= Picasa_Ruby

Picasa_Ruby is a Picasa API for ruby. It is a mirror of picasaonrails from googlecode.

Some code examples will likely be helpful...

The login session is simple:

	require "picasa"

	picasa = Picasa::Picasa.new
	picasa.login("username", "password")

Once the session object is obtained, you can use it to collect, and use your Picasa albums. For example, you might print the albums and the photos to the command line as follows:
	albums = picasa.albums(:access => "private")
	albums.each do |album|
	  puts "===== Album ======"
	  puts album.id
	  puts album.name

	  puts album.thumbnail.url
	  puts album.thumbnail.width
	  puts album.thumbnail.height

	  photos = album.photos
	  if(photos.size > 0)
	    photos.each do |photo|
	      puts "====== Photo ====="
	      puts photo.id
	      puts photo.title
	      puts photo.url
	      photo.thumbnails.each do |thumbnail|
	        puts thumbnail.url
	        puts thumbnail.width
	        puts thumbnail.height
	      end
	    end
	  else
	    puts "====== No photo for this album ====="
	  end
	end

You can also create an album as follows:
	album = picasa.create_album(:title => "Album From Ruby", 
	  :summary => "This album is created from ruby code",
	  :location => "Bangladesh", :keywords => "keyword1, keyword2")

Or even post a photo to an existing album:
	fileName = "~/Photos/blue_hills.jpg"
	image_data = open(fileName, "rb").read
	photo = picasa.post_photo(image_data, :album => "AlbumFromRuby", 
	  :summary => "Upload2 from ruby api", :title => "From Ruby 2",
	  :local_file_name => "blue_hills.jpg")
